# DWUK Banking Application

Every bank needs to keep track and manage its accounts.

The DWUK Banking Application enhances cashier performance by ensuring fast and reliable service, transforming customer visits into pleasant experiences.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **NextJS:** modern React framework that helps me with frontend routing
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript, selected for its ability to augment project safety. By introducing static typing, TypeScript furnishes me with a shield against runtime errors. Although it may demand additional development time, I view this investment as integral to ensuring the reliability and stability of my software
- **Testing:** I chose `Jest` for testing because I already have experience writing tests using this technology

### Backend

- **NodeJS:** an asynchronous JavaScript runtime environment. Widely used for building web servers
- **ExpressJS:** a `NodeJS` framework great for web APIs
- **TypeScript:** *same as on frontend above*
- **MySQL:** relational database; a good choice for interdependent data like in the case of our DWUK Banking Application

## How to Install and Run the Project Locally
