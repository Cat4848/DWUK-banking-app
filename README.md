# DWUK Banking Web Application

## Backend (API) Module

The DWUK Banking App is divided into 2 repositories:

- the current documentation is for the _Backend Module_ and
- [this is the frontend module](https://github.com/Cat4848/client-dwuk-banking-app)

## Live Deployment

I deployed the app on _Vercel_ and it's fully connected to the backend for a seamless experience.

Please have a look at the [live link here](https://client-dwuk-banking-app.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **NodeJS:** a popular and asynchronous JavaScript runtime environment
- **ExpressJS:** a `NodeJS` framework – great for web APIs
- **TypeScript:** I love safety – A superset of JavaScript, selected for its ability to augment project safety. By introducing static typing, TypeScript furnishes me with a shield against runtime errors. Although it may demand additional development time, I view this investment as integral to ensuring the reliability and stability of my software.
- **MySQL:** relational database; a good choice for interdependent data like the data tree of our DWUK Banking Application.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, please execute the following command in a terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/Cat4848/api-dwuk-banking-app`
